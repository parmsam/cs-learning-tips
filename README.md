# CS learning resources and tips

The info below includes resources I wish I knew about earlier in my learning journey. Some of them will be better than others depending on your interests and technical background. I originally made this for friends or family interested in a comp sci field or starting a univeristy program. Hopefully it's useful. Note that this isn't meant to be a comprehensive learning plan. Experiment and decide what works for you.  No need to follow any tips exactly. 

## Github
* Setup a Github account to use for your public projects portfolio - https://github.com/
    * Use Github Pages to create your own website (to add a personal touch) - https://pages.github.com/
        * Consider using a prebuilt template that’s already available

## Workflow
* Create a second brain. Tryout a conceptual note-taking system instead of a sequential note taking approach. Note that this might not work if you have a sharp deadline where you need to memorize the applications.
    * Watch this video on what a conceptual note taking approach is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYJsGksojms&ab_channel=ChrisPomeroy
    * Try using Obsidian: https://obsidian.md/
        * Consider getting the paid sync plan, after you tried it out.
    * Consider reading or listening to these books on learning and note taking:
        * Building a Second Brain: https://a.co/d/5OATEw9
        * How to Take Smart Notes: https://a.co/d/5OATEw9
        * Art of learning: https://a.co/d/8y8bZQq
       * Rationality from AI to Zombies: https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rationality:-from-ai-to-zombies
* Use Alfred if you use a MacBook: https://www.alfredapp.com/
    * Buy a Powerpack after you’ve used it. It will save you a lot of time if you use it right.

## Technical learning
* On technical learning
    * Find new problems -

            * Hackathons at your university or in the area
            * Leet code - https://leetcode.com/
            * Advent of Code - https://adventofcode.com/
    * Backlog interesting projects - 
        * Backlog any interesting or fun projects you would like to work on but don’t have time now (share the projects on Github). Work on them in free time. - 
            * Here’s an example Birthday GIF card I made a few weeks back to try out URL parameters: https://parmsam.github.io/birthday-gif-card/?name=John&age=21
